# **Project Update (03/01/2019)**
Note: Tick mark means completed tasks. Will be removed in the latter project update documents.
## Parikh (HIV mutation analysis)
*Summary: Finding mutations in  HIV RT sequences resistant to drugs from clinical trails and MP samples*
- [x] 1. Check automation of Contamination Analysis pipeline on ASPIRE samples
- [ ] 2. Work on transferring Contamination Analysis pipeline to NextFlow for packaging
- [ ] 3. Work on manuscript on Mutation Analysis & Contamination Analysis 
- [ ] 4. HIV Mutation Pipeline Update1: Include the code of collecting random virion sequences with condtion of Sample > 25K virions, then randomly select 25K virions.
- [ ] 5. HIV Mutation Pipeline Update2: Include the steps for overlap pairs in paired end library. Reference for virion assembly still need to be provided by Kerri to test run this update.
- [ ] 6. Work on implementing INT samples with ref6, ref8 and generate mutation report.

## Kevin Joseph (HIV sequence integration in Human analysis)
*Summary: Finding HIV human junctions and assembly of pro-virus*

### Human+HIV junction region:

- [ ] 1. Conduct test on cutoff position for HIV+Human integration at different percentage coverage vs. length of integration region

### Bringing together the results of Integration Assembly and Provirus Assembly

- [ ] 1. For samples with discrepancy with Kevin's manual assembly, explore reasons and resolve the discrepancy
- [ ] 2. For samples which were assembled into provirus sequences, concatenate the assembly of integration region
- [ ] 3. Meet with group Friday March 29, 2019 at 12:30 PM

### Presentation to Dr. Mellors
 [ ] 1. Work on slides to present the pipelines worked on junction region and provirus assembly

## Prepare for Workshop/Training of CORE group on HIV projects

### Chandran Group Workshop: Rahil Sethi
- [x] 1. Continue with the remainder of HIV mutation pipeline
- [x] 2. Discuss if they were able to run and understand each step of the pipeline
- [x] 3. Introduce them with HIV Contamination Analysis pipeline
- [x] 4. Give Traning sesison on complete HIV Contamination Pipeline
- [ ] 5. Make Training ppt on Human+HIV integration project
- [ ] 6. Make Training ppt on Provirus assembly project
